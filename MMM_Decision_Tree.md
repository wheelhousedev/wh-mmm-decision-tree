## Client Assessment Questions

### Client Goals & Objectives

**1. What is the your organization's primary business objective?**
*   **Good Fit:** We want to understand the ROI of their marketing channels, optimize budget allocation, identify diminishing returns, and forecast the impact of future marketing investments.
*   **Poor Fit:** We want to know which specific ad creative is performing best, understand real-time campaign performance, or attribute individual conversions to specific touchpoints.

**2. What is the primary purpose of the measurement?**
*   **Good Fit:** We need to justify marketing spend to leadership and is looking for ways to optimize for better performance.
*   **Poor Fit:** We primarily need to report on marketing activities and basic performance metrics.

**3. What is your planning horizon?**
*   **Good Fit:** We are focused on annual or multi-year strategic planning and wants to understand the sustainable drivers of growth.
*   **Poor Fit:** We are need to make rapid, in-flight adjustments to campaigns on a daily or weekly basis.

**4. Is your organization interested in understanding cross-channel effects?**
*   **Good Fit:** We want to understand how different marketing channels interact with each other (e.g., how TV ads impact search queries).
*   **Poor Fit:** We are only interested in the performance of individual channels in isolation.

### Data & Analytics Readiness

**5. How much historical data can the client provide?**
*   **Good Fit:** We can provide at least 2 years of continuous weekly data for all significant marketing channels and conversion metrics.
*   **Poor Fit:** We have less than 2 years of data, the data is not granular (e.g., monthly instead of weekly), or there are significant gaps.

**6. How many distinct marketing channels are being used?**
*   **Good Fit:** We have a diverse marketing mix with several channels (e.g., TV, Radio, Social Media, Search) that have variable spending patterns.
*   **Poor Fit:** We rely on only one or two marketing channels, or the spending has been constant with little variation.

**7. What kind of data can the your organization provide?**
*   **Good Fit:** We can provide granular data on marketing spend, impressions, clicks, and conversions, along with relevant external factors (e.g., promotions, economic data, competitor activity). The data is clean, consistent, and well-organized.
*   **Poor Fit:** We can only provide high-level data (e.g., total marketing spend), or the data is inconsistent, messy, or missing key variables.

**8. Is third-party or external data available?**
*   **Good Fit:** We can provide or is willing to acquire data on external factors like competitor spending, economic indicators, promotions, or major events.
*   **Poor Fit:** We only have access to their own internal marketing and sales data.

## Decision & Recommendations

**Conclusion:** The client is likely a **STRONG CANDIDATE** for MMM.

**Next Steps:**
1.  Proceed with a deeper dive into the data requirements for Meridian.
2.  Scope the MMM project, outlining timelines, deliverables, and costs.
3.  Begin the data collection and integration process.

### If the answers are mostly "Poor Fit":

**Alternative Solutions:**

*   **For tactical/creative optimization goals:**
    *   **Recommendation:** Propose **A/B Testing** or **Multivariate Testing** to determine the effectiveness of specific creatives or landing pages.
    *   **Recommendation:** Suggest **Attribution Modeling** (e.g., last-touch, multi-touch) to provide more immediate insights into which channels are driving conversions.
*   **If data is insufficient or of low quality:**
    *   **Recommendation:** Propose a **Data Readiness Assessment** to help the client improve their data collection and storage practices.
    *   **Recommendation:** Suggest starting with a smaller-scale analysis, such as a **Scenario Forecasting** project based on available data and industry benchmarks, to demonstrate the value of data-driven decision-making.
*   **For forward-looking goals without historical data:**
    *   **Recommendation:** Propose **Scenario Forecasting** to model potential outcomes based on different assumptions and market conditions.
